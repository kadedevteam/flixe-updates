## Pages Pro v2.3.1 Realesed

This patch release of the 2.3 series is released to fix a bug where the `include` tag does not allow valid filename characters. 
For example, this would previously fail:
```
{include error: playstate:1;2; include_error_patch;}
```

This release adds support for the following characters in filenames:
- `@`
- `-`
- `(` and `)`
- `+`
- `~`
- `#`
